Based on the template from the [City Scrapers](https://cityscrapers.org/) project. This scrapes, standardizes, and shares public meetings from local government websites in California. You can find more information on the [project homepage](https://cityscrapers.org/) or in the original City Scrapers repo for the Chicago area: [City-Bureau/city-scrapers](https://github.com/City-Bureau/city-scrapers).

## Scrapers Implemented

We currently pull meeting and agenda data from the Board of Supervisors in the Counties of Los Angeles and (the City and County of) San Fransisco as well as the local government in Los Angeles city.

## Washington Abstract

[Washington Abstract](https://washingtonabstract.com) helps experts track, collaborate, and impact legislation. We are using City Scrapers to scrape local government data.
