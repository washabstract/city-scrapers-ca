(415) 554-5163  http://www.sfwater.org/rboc \nSan Francisco, CA 94102   \n \n  \n \nBackground \n \nIn November 2003, the Public Utilities Revenue Bond Oversight Committee (RBOC) \nwas formed after passage of Proposition P (November 2002), adding Sections 5A.30 \nthrough 5A.36 to the San Francisco Administrative Code.  \nThe RBOC facilitates transparency and accountability in the expenditure of revenue \nbond proceeds.  The public is invited and welcome to attend RBOC meetings and \nprovide input.     \nPursuant to Administrative Code, Section 5A.36, the RBOC is charged with \nproviding independent oversight of the expenditure of public utility revenue bond \nproceeds for capital improvements.  The committee helps ensure an uninterrupted \nsupply of water, power, and wastewater treatment services to the City and County \nand San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) customers.  Further, it \nhelps ensure public dollars are spent in accordance with the authorizing bond \nresolutions and applicable laws.  \nAfter conducting an independent audit, and consulting with the City Attorney, the \nRBOC may determine that proceeds of a revenue bond program were not utilized for \npurposes authorized in accordance with the associated bond resolution or applicable \nlaw.  It may be further determined that this surmounts to an illegal expenditure or \nwaste of such revenue bonds.  By majority vote, the RBOC may prohibit the \nissuance or sale of authorized revenue bonds that have yet to be issued or sold.  \nAny RBOC decision to prohibit the sale of authorized but unsold revenue bonds may \nbe appealed to the Board of Supervisors. The SFPUC can provide evidence of \ncorrective measures to the Board, and the Board may decide to overturn the \ndecision by the RBOC, upon a two-thirds vote of all of its members. To date, the \nRBOC has not prevented any issuance of SFPUC revenue bonds.  \nThe SFPUC continues to incur bonded indebtedness to finance capital \nimprovements related to its two major enterprises, the Water and Sewer systems. \nEach of these enterprises have embarked on major system improvement programs, \nwhich are expected to be completed in 2021 and beyond, respectively.  However, \nthe provisions of Proposition P were set to expire on January 1, 2013, unless \nextended by an ordinance of the Board of Supervisors.   \nIn 2012, the Board extended the sunset date to January 1, 2016, (see Ordinance \nNo. 236-12, BOS File No. 120221). Accordingly, in 2015, the SFPUC submitted, and \nthe Board of Supervisors approved, a resolution supporting the extension of the \nRBOC until January 1, 2019.  On December 11, 2018, the Board of Supervisors \napproved Ordinance No. 309-18, BOS File No. 180123, extending the RBOC \nthrough January 1, 2025.    \nMission Statement \n \nThe Revenue Bond Oversight Committee (RBOC) monitors the expenditure of revenue \nbond proceeds related to the repair, replacement, upgrade and expansion of the \nSFPUC\u2019s water, power and sewer infrastructure. The RBOC provides independent \noversight to ensure transparency and accountability.  The RBOC\u2019s goal is to ensure that \nSFPUC revenue bond proceeds are spent for their intended purposes in accordance \nwith legislative authorization and other applicable laws. \n \nAccomplishments in 2020 \n \nDuring 2020, RBOC achievement highlights include the following: \n\u2022  Strategized with SFPUC and other city staff to prepare and finalize for the \nrevenue bond expenditure audits process. \n\u2022  Monitored the outcome of bond sales and ongoing debt plans. \n\u2022  Reviewed progress of WSIP and SSIP with particular focus on the accuracy \nof budgeting and scheduling forecasts and continued attention to ensuring \nthat lessons learned from the WSIP are applied during implementation of \nthe SSIP. \n\u2022  Heard presentations from SFPUC staff on results of Wastewater bond sales \nand updates on the WIFIA loan transaction. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFuture Activities \nActivities and topics the RBOC expects to cover in 2021 include the following: \n\u2022 Monitor the progress of the Audit of the revenue bond expenditure process \n\u2022 Monitor completion of the Water System Improvement Program (WSIP) and other \nmajor Water Enterprise capital projects, including Mountain Tunnel. \n\u2022 Review the SFPUC\u2019s work, both planned and completed, towards the Sewer \nSystem Improvement Program (SSIP). \n\u2022 Ensure the continuity of oversight through member succession planning \n\u2022 Improve outreach to ensure greater public awareness and input related to the \nSFPUC\u2019s expenditure of revenue bond proceeds.  \nCommittee Membership \nMembership \n  The RBOC is comprised of seven members:   \n\u2022  Two seats appointed by the Mayor  \n\u2022  Two seats appointed by the Board of Supervisors  \n\u2022  One seat appointed by the City Controller \n\u2022  One seat appointed by the Bay Area Water User's \nAssociation (BAWUA), under the auspices of the Bay \nArea Water Supply and Conservation Agency \n(BAWSCA), and  \n\u2022  One seat occupied by the Budget and Legislative \nAnalyst or his/her representative.  \nAt a minimum, the members appointed by the Mayor and the Board \nshall, individually or collectively, have expertise, skills and experience \nin economics, the environment, construction, and project \nmanagement.  \nThe member appointed by the Controller shall have background and \nexperience in auditing, accounting, and project finance.   \nBiographies of current RBOC members is included below.
