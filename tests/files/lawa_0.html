		<center><u>LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE REGISTRATION</u></center>

		<BR><BR>

		The City's Municipal Lobbying Ordinance (Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 48.01 et seq., as Amended)  states  "Every  Lobbyist  and  Lobbying  Firm  shall  register  with  the  City  Ethics Commission within 10 days after qualifying..." City law defines a "Lobbyist" as "Any person who is compensated to spend 30 or more hours in any consecutive three-month period engaged in lobbying  activities  which  include  at  least  one  direct communication  with  a  City  Official  or employee, conducted either personally or through agents, for the purpose of attempting to influence municipal legislation on behalf of any other person."
		<BR><BR>

		To ensure that all parties who may be subject to the Law have the information they need to comply with its provisions, the Secretary to the Board will forward copies of all speaker cards to the City Ethics Commission.  For more information about the City's Lobbying Law and how it may apply to you, contact the Ethics Commission at (213) 978-1960, or at 200 N. Spring Street, City Hall, 24th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90012.
		<BR><BR>

		<u>Los  Angeles City Charter Section No. 245</u>.   Commission  and Board Actions - City Council
		Review.
		<BR><BR>

		Actions of Commissions and Boards become final at the expiration of the next five meeting days of the City Council during which the Council has convened in Regular Session, unless City Council acts within that time by a two-thirds vote to bring the Commission or Board action before it for consideration and action.   If the Council asserts jurisdiction, the Commission or Board will immediately transmit the action to the City Clerk for review by the Council and the particular action of the Board or Commission is not to be deemed final or approved.  The City Clerk, upon receipt of the action, will place the action on the next available Council agenda in accordance with applicable State law and Council rules. If the Council asserts jurisdiction over the action, it may, by a two-thirds vote, veto the action of the Board, but it must make a final decision on the matter before the expiration of the next 21 calendar days from voting to bring the matter before it, or the action of the Commission or Board becomes final.
		<BR><BR>

		This section shall not apply to actions by any Commission or Board required to be referred for approval to Council or which have been appealed to Council under other provisions of the Charter, ordinance or statute.

			Sign language interpreters, communication access real-time transcription, assistive listening devices, or other auxiliary aids and/or services may be provided upon request. To ensure availability, you are advised to make your request at least 72 hours prior to the meeting you wish to attend.

			<br><br>
			PUBLIC COMMENTS ON AGENDA ITEMS: Each public speaker will have no longer than three minutes per agenda item to politely address the Board.
			<br><br>
			The Presiding Officer shall, however, exercise discretion to determine whether the time for general public comments or public comments on agenda items should be reduced or extended based upon such factors as the length of the agenda or substance of the agenda items, the number of public comment speaker cards submitted, the need for the Board to conclude its business as expeditiously as is practicable, and whether the Board is at risk of losing a quorum, among other factors.
